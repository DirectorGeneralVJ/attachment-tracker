# Attachment Tracker (Python CLI)

A command-line Python application to manage and track Computer Science students preparing for industrial attachment.

This project demonstrates practical Python skills, object-oriented programming, file handling, and real-world CLI applications — exactly what supervisors and recruiters look for in a portfolio.

# Features

*Add Student – Record new students with name, year, and course.
*View Students – Display all registered students in a clear list.
*Search Students by Course – Quickly find all students in a specific course (case-insensitive).
*Delete Student – Remove a student by number from the list.
*Update Student Details – Update any student's name, year, or course.
*Count Students by Course – See how many students are enrolled in a given course.
*Persistent Storage – All student data is stored in a text file (students.txt) automatically.

# Technologies Used

*Python 3.x
*Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
*File Handling (.txt persistence)
*Command-Line Interface (CLI)

# Installation & Setup

# Portfolio Highlights

* Clear menu-driven CLI showing professional software design.
* OOP principles applied correctly for maintainable, scalable code.
* Iteration-friendly: Easy to add new features.
* Attachment-ready: Demonstrates practical problem-solving.
* Persistent data storage ensures usability beyond single sessions.

# Future Improvements

* Integrate MySQL or SQLite for more robust persistence.
* Add search by multiple fields (year + course).
* Implement unit testing to demonstrate code reliability.
